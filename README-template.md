## My process

**First**

I set my file structure up. I added and linked a stylesheet and javascript file to the HTML file.

**Second**

I opened the style guide to get the colors to set up root variables for the colors, get the font family, font size, and any other information to help set up the styles.

**Third**

I opened the mobile design and active images to see what the mobile view and active view is supposed to look like.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
-

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for reference when double checking how to do things that I forgot how to do, like the linear gradient background colors.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
